Restoring a previous version of a file or folder from RDSS
==========================================================

This document explains how to to restore previous versions of a file or
folder in RDSS/FSMResFiles.

The Research Data Storage Service (RDSS) creates snapshots of files
stored on the system that are kept for 28 days. Snapshots occur daily
between 7 pm and midnight. This feature allows users to retrieve files
that were accidentally modified or deleted with some exceptions:

-  Files that were modified/deleted more than 28 days ago cannot be
   restored because snapshots are deleted after 28 days.
-  Files that were created then modified/deleted within 24 hours may not
   be able to be restored because they may not have been on the file
   system when a snapshot occurred.

Retrieving older versions of modified/deleted files
---------------------------------------------------

The instructions below describe how to restore older versions of files
or deleted files contained in snapshots on RDSS.

**Note**: This process can only be done on computers running the Windows
operating system. If you cannot mount your RDSS share on a Mac or Linux
machine, please contact consultant@northwestern.edu for assistance in
retrieving your files.
