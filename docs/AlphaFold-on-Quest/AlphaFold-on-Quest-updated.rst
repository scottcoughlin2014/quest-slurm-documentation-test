AlphaFold on Quest
==================

How to run AlphaFold on Quest

Currently, we have AlphaFold version 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 (with multimers)
installed on Quest. For more details on both releases of AlphaFold,
please visit the `AlphaFold
website <https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold>`__.

         Workloads Installed On Quest?
         :name: how-is-alphafold-2.1.1-with-separate-cpu-and-gpu-workloads-installed-on-quest

      AlphaFold 2.1.1 is installed inside of a Singularity container
      following the `instructions from the DeepMind
      team <https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold/blob/c9ffb0bc187077602c1940269612fa8df1674fbf/docker/Dockerfile>`__.

      The container contains CUDA 11.1, Python 3.7.11, TensorFlow 2.5.0,
      jax 0.2.25, and jaxlib 0.1.69+cuda111. *In addition, please note
      that this install of AlphaFold contains a modification to
      AlphaFold in order to allow for the CPU and GPU parts of AlphaFold
      to be run separately.* We added the following flag

      ``+flags.DEFINE_boolean('only_msas', False, 'Whether to only build MSAs, and not do any prediction.')``
      Instead of calling singularity directly, we provide a module which
      wraps the call to the ``singularity run``.

      ``module load alphafold/2.1.1-only-msas-flag-addition``
      This creates a\ **two** shell functions, one for running Alphafold
      multimer (``alphafold-multimer``), and one for use with Alpha
      monomer (``alphafold-monomer``).

      .. code:: code

         alphafold-monomer --fasta_paths=/full/path/to/fasta \
           --output_dir=/full/path/to/outdir \
           --max_template_date= \
           --only_msas=[true|false] \
           --use_precomputed_msas=[true|false] \
           --model_preset=[monomer|monomer_casp14|monomer_ptm] \
           --db_preset=full_dbs \

      -  **model_preset**

         -  **monomer**: This is the original model used at CASP14 with
            no ensembling.
         -  **monomer_casp14**: This is the original model used at
            CASP14 with num_ensemble=8, matching our CASP14
            configuration. This is largely provided for reproducibility
            as it is 8x more computationally expensive for limited
            accuracy gain (+0.1 average GDT gain on CASP14 domains).
         -  **monomer_ptm**: This is the original CASP14 model fine
            tuned with the pTM head, providing a pairwise confidence
            measure. It is slightly less accurate than the normal
            monomer model.

      -  **use_precomputed_msas**

         -  Whether to read MSAs that have been written to disk.

      -  **only_msas**

         -  Whether to only build MSAs, and not do any prediction.

      .. code:: code

           --db_preset=full_dbs \
           --is_prokaryote_list=[true|false] 

      -  **model_preset**

         -  **multimer**: This is the AlphaFold-Multimer model. To use
            this model, provide a multi-sequence FASTA file. In
            addition, the UniProt database should have been downloaded.

      -  **is_prokaryote_list**

         -  optionally set the â€“is_prokaryote_list flag with booleans
            that determine whether all input sequences in the given
            fasta file are prokaryotic. If that is not the case or the
            origin is unknown, set to false for that fasta.

      -  **use_precomputed_msas**

         -  Whether to read MSAs that have been written to disk.

      -  **only_msas**

         -  Whether to only build MSAs, and not do any prediction.

      If you would like to see the contents of the shell function
      ``alphafold-multimer`` or ``alphafold-monomer``, you can run
      ``type``\ ``alphafold-monome``\ r or ``type alphafold-multimer``
      on the command line.
