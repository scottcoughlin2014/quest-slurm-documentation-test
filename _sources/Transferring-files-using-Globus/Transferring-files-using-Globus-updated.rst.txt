      from a list of search results. You may need to authenticate to
      access the endpoint. See the section for the endpoint you’re using
      below for more information.

   and folders inside the collection you selected. Choose the files you
   want to transfer by clicking on the file. A check mark should appear
   to the left of the file.

   collection, but in the right hand Collection search box. Then select
   the folder you want the file to be transferred to.

   complete.
