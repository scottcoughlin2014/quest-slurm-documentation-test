      -  Open Windows Explorer and open the mapped network drive. If you
         have not yet mapped the drive, please visit the instructions on
         how to connect to a Research Data Storage Service share
         location.
      -  Find the file you want to open. The file name will be the same
         as a non-archived file, but the icon will have an arrow on it,
         indicating that it is a link to a file that is located in
         archive.
      -  Double-click the file to open it.

         -  If an error occurs, please make sure you have completed the
            configuration steps.
         -  If you access the same file five or more times in a 15-day
            period, it will be removed from archive and become active,
            and the icon will change to indicate its status.
