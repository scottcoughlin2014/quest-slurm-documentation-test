The two commonly used methods for logging in to Quest are using the
FastX client and through a secure shell (SSH) terminal.

If youâ€™ll be working with GUI (graphical window) applications, FastX is
recommended.

Connecting with FastX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The FastX Desktop Client is an application for Microsoft Windows and
  Mac OS X personal computers that makes a network connection to Quest
  using SSH. It gives you a connection to the Quest Linux servers with
  full graphics support via the Linux X Windows system, also called X11.
