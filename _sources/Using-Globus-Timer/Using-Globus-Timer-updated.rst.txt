==================

This document describes how to use the Globus timer feature to automate
and schedule data transfers

   The Globus Timer feature allows you to schedule data workflows for a
   certain date and time with the option to repeat these workflows on a
   specified schedule.

   To use these options, first select the files you would like to
   transfer as you would normally. Then, Click “Transfer and timer
   options” between the source and destination search boxes in the File
   Manager screen.

   .. rubric:: Transfer settings
      :name: transfer-settings

   Globus provides pre-defined transfer settings that you can choose
   from. To apply these to your transfer, click the box to the left of
   the setting. For more information about what these settings do, click
   the info button to the right of the setting. These options will be
   applied when you hit the Start button to begin the transfer.

   When dealing with especially large data transfers, you may want to
   schedule them for a time when the network is expected to have the
   least amount of traffic.

   .. rubric:: One time transfer
      :name: one-time-transfer

   To schedule a transfer, specify a time in the Schedule Start field.
   This will schedule a one time transfer at the specified time when you
   hit the Start Button.

   .. rubric:: Repeat transfers
      :name: repeat-transfers

   If you would like to schedule a transfer that occurs at a regular
   interval, choose the interval you would like (days, hours, minutes)
   from the Repeat dropdown menu.

   Then specify the frequency (eg: every 3 days) and when you would like
   the recurrence to end, on a certain date or after a given number of
   times. This feature is very similar to setting recurring meeting
   invitations in Microsoft Outlook.

   Once the transfer has been submitted by hitting the start button, you
   can view and/or remove their scheduled transfer via the Activity page
   and the Timers tab.
