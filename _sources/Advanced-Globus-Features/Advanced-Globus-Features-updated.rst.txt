========================

This document outlines advanced features of the Globus data transfer
tool.

.. container::
   :name: doc-summary

   You can do much more with Globus than transfer data. See the
   following for more information on Sharing data and automating data
   workfows using Globus timer and Globus’s command line interface.

   .. rubric:: Globus Command Line Interface
      :name: globus-command-line-interface

   Many of the functions illustrated above in the Globus Web interface
   can be performed in the Globus Command Line Interface (CLi) See
   `Globus’s CLI documentation <https://docs.globus.org/cli/>`__ for
   more information.

   .. rubric:: Globus Timer
      :name: globus-timer

   The Globus Timer feature allows you to schedule data workflows for a
   certain date and time with the option to repeat these workflows on a
   specified schedule. See `Using Globus
   Timer <https://services.northwestern.edu/TDClient/30/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=2020>`__
   for instructions on how to use Globus timer. Globus Timer also has a
   `command line
   interface. <https://pypi.org/project/globus-timer-cli/>`__

   .. rubric:: Globus Flows
      :name: globus-flows

   Globus flows allow you to automate data workflows, like moving data
   from an instrument and doing preprocessing steps, by combining its
   data transfer capability with “actions” that perform computational
   tasks within Globus and through external service providers. See
   `Globus’s Flows
   documentation <https://www.globus.org/platform/services/flows>`__ for
   more information.

   .. rubric:: Globus APIs
      :name: globus-apis

   Globus provides REST APIs for many globus features. See `Globus’s API
   documentation <https://docs.globus.org/api/>`__ for more details.
